#Project is created with .Net Core 3.1

#Some tests are written for expected results and for some invalid reasons and exceptions.
#Plateau range must be positive area, rover can move only in plateau area, out of range gives error.
#Console method works for one plateau area, multiple rovers and moveLetters.
#Test project is created to test one rover. But for multiple rover can repeat same move letters and same position, expected result will be same.
#Face letters can be only N,S,E,W and upper case, move letters can be only L,R and M.
#If everything is valid, method gives the expected result.
